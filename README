zimsearch is a simple proof-of-concept implementation of a GNOME Shell search 
provider for Zim pages.

1. Installation

See INSTALL for installation instructions.

2. Usage

Search terms typed in the GNOME Shell overview are used to lookup Zim pages 
from the default notebook. Clicking in a search result opens Zim (if not 
already open) and shows the selected page. The same syntax as command "zim 
--search" is accepted, e.g. "tag:" (see Zim manual).

It is possible to search pages in a different notebook by passing the special 
term "notebook:<NAME>", replacing "<NAME>" by the notebook name (if you need to 
search using a term starting with "notebook:", simply wrap it in double 
quotes).
