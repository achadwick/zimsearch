It's worth seeing where files will go first:

    python2 ./setup.py --dry-run install
    python ./setup.py --dry-run install --prefix=/usr

When you're happy with the scenario, run the setup script command
without --dry-run. The default installation goes in /usr/local, try
this if you're unsure:

    python2 ./setup.py install

Due to limitations of the GNOME search provider interface, this plugin
must be installed into $XDG_DATA_DIRS (i.e. /usr/local/share or
/usr/share). The default prefix will do this. You cannot install it
sensibly into $XDG_DATA_HOME ($HOME/.local/share) because DBus service
activation requires an absolute path.
