zimsearch is a simple proof-of-concept implementation of a GNOME Shell search 
provider for Zim pages.

**THIS IS VERY EARLY ALPHA SOFTWARE. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK**

# Installation

See INSTALL for installation instructions.

# Usage

Search terms typed in the GNOME Shell overview are used to lookup Zim pages 
from your notebooks. Page titles are matched against the search terms and 
only pages that contain all terms are shown. By default, all notebooks are 
searched, but there is a plugin setting to limit search to the default notebook 
only. It is also possible to limit search to a certain notebook by adding a 
term preceded by a hashtag sign (#). Only notebooks whose name contains the # 
term are searched. If multiple # terms are typed, all but the first one are 
ignored.
